Tables => User, Company and BusinessHour
BusinessHour stores the opening and closing hour

User registers->logins->creates company->adds businesshour->manipulates business hours

Business hour logic -> 

if isClosingDay is true then the day is closed
if the business hour data is present for a day in BusinessHour table use that data else use defaultStarting and closing hour stored in company

if both business hour data and default hour data are missing, specify the day as open 24hrs or not set or anything appropriate
